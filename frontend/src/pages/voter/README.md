# Voter Pages

This directory contains components related to the Voter flow, including:

- Voter registration and verification
- Ballot viewing and voting
- Vote confirmation

These pages are separate from the admin/host flow and are accessed via unique ballot links.
Voters don't need to access the main election management interface.

Note: The original files still exist in their original locations for backward compatibility.
